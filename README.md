# Personal Homepage Project

Welcome to my personal website! You can visit it here: [Jiacheng Xue's Homepage](https://logan14925.github.io/gh_page/). This project is crafted using MkDocs and seamlessly deployed through GitHub Pages.



## Project Overview

This is a personal homepage project built using MkDocs and GitHub Pages. MkDocs is a fast and simple static site generator, particularly well-suited for project documentation and personal homepages. With GitHub Pages, we can easily deploy the website to the internet.
