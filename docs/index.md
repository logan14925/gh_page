# Xue Jiacheng - Personal Homepage

Welcome to my personal academic homepage. This page provides an overview of my academic background, research interests, projects, publications, and contact information.

## Personal Background

My name is **Xue Jiacheng**, and I am currently a second-year Master's student in the Department of [Your Program Name] at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**. I specialize in the fields of **3D Printing**, **Robotics**, and **AI + Metamaterials**. My academic journey is driven by a passion for exploring the intersection of advanced manufacturing technologies, intelligent systems, and novel materials.

In addition to my academic training, I am focused on understanding the implications and applications of these fields in solving real-world problems. I am now seeking opportunities to further my research at the PhD level, particularly in the United States, where I aim to contribute to ongoing advancements in these cutting-edge areas of study.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests lie in the following areas:

- **3D Printing**: Exploring novel techniques in additive manufacturing, with a particular focus on **online monitoring of 3D printing** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for real-time classification. This approach aims to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the 3D printing process by detecting and correcting errors during production.

- **Robotics**: Investigating intelligent systems for automation, including the development of complete robotic systems based on **STM32 microcontroller platforms**. 

- **AI + Metamaterials**: Using **Generative Neural Networks** to perform **inverse design** of **metamaterials**, optimizing their properties such as strength, flexibility, and energy absorption. These AI-driven designs have significant potential for applications in engineering, material science, and physics, allowing for the creation of advanced materials with tailored properties for various functional applications.


I am particularly interested in how these fields intersect, with a goal of creating integrated systems that combine AI-driven optimization with novel material properties to address global challenges.

## Academic Background

I am pursuing my Master's degree in **State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering** at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**. My coursework in **Mechanical Design Fundamentals**, **Modern Control**, **Material Mechanics**, and **Advanced Machine Learning** has provided a strong foundation in mechanical systems, control theory, material properties, and machine learning, equipping me with the skills needed for my research in 3D printing, robotics, and AI-driven metamaterials design.


In addition to my degree program, I have participated in various research projects, including a three-year involvement in the **RoboMaster Robotics Competition**, where I contributed to the design and development of robotic systems. In my senior year, I served as the **team captain** of a 40-member robotics team, leading the group in strategic planning, system integration, and competition preparation. 

In **July 2024**, I interned at **West Lake Interactive Robotics Company**, where I was responsible for **STM32-based motor control tasks**, focusing on developing control algorithms and hardware integration for robotic motion systems.
